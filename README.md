## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

This was built with the purpose of exploring mobile-first responsive design, it's made with HTML and CSS. Floating was used to position elements as a means to gain experience for the future if ever I need to work on older codebases. It also served as practice in making a functional website from a provided psd file. 

## Planned Features

* Add multiple pages

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt about how to make a website from a provided psd file, as well as using floats in positioning and using media querys for reponsive design. I also learnt about mobile-first design and its merits, its definitely easier to make a website reponsive when you make it mobile-first
